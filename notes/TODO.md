- [[Phase Gate]]
- [[Quantum Algorithms]]: example of an algorithm (Grover ?).
- [[Poset]], [[Least Upper Bound]], [[Complete Partial Order]], [[Lattice]]. [[Partial Order]]
- [[Standard Topology]] [[Scott Continuous]], [[Topological Limit]]
### Preliminaries
**stuff to read**
- [[Towards a Quantum Programming Language]]
	- **preliminaries**
		- [[Hermitian Operator#Remarks 2.1]] proof to do. 
		- [[Positive Operator#Remarks 2.2]] proof to do.
		- [[Unitary Transformation on QC#Todo]] stuff + proposition to do
		- [[CPO of Density Matrices#Proposition 3.6]] proof to do
	- **Quantum Flow Charts**: to understand
- quantum and quantum information (neilseng), (first 4 chaps and maybe appendixes on probability)
- an introduction to quantum computing (mosca)
- foundation of quantum programming (ying)
