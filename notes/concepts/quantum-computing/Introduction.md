**Quantum Computing concerns the relationship between physics and computer science.**
> Computers are physical objects, and computations are physical processes. What computers can or can not compute is determined by the laws of physics and not by pure mathematics 

**Q:** Why are classical computers so bad at simulating quantum systems? 
**A:** A quantum system involving $n$ particles requires a number of parameters exponential in $n$

**Quantum Physics** is a mathematical model first used to describe physical phenomena that occur at the microscopic level, such as inside an atom, which exposed gaps in the preceding theory of "classical" physics. 

The quantum description is often at odds with our intuition, which has evolved according to observations of macroscopic phenomena which are, to an extremely good approximation classical. 

**A quantum computer is a machine that uses quantum mechanics to perform calculations.**
