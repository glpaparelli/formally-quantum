### Circuits
Circuits are networks composed of **wires** that carry bit values to **gates** that perform elementary operations on the bits. 

We consider **acyclic** circuits: the bits move through the circuit and the wires never feed back to a prior location in the circuit. 
$C_n =$ circuit with $n$ input variables.

### Families of Circuits
- boolean circuits are a **non-uniform model of computation**
	- a circuit with $n$ input variables can solve only instances of length n
	- **inputs of different lengths are processed by different circuits**, in contrast with uniform models such as Turing machines where the same computational device is used for all possible input lengths. **A different "program" for each input size.**
- an individual computational problem is thus associated with a **family of  boolean circuits** $\{C_n\ |\ n \in \mathbb{N}\}$

#### Non-Uniform Families of Circuits
Non-uniform families of small size may compute **undecidable** functions. 

Let $L \subseteq \{0,1\}^*$ be an undecidable language: a language that cannot be recognized by a turing machine that halts for all inputs and correctly decides whether an input belongs to the set $L$ or not. 
$L =\{\ \text{binary encodings of pairs}\ \langle M, x\rangle\ \text{s.t. the turing machine M halts on input} x\ \}$

Now let $U = \{1^n:\ \text{the binary expansion of}\ n\ \text{is in}\ L\}$ 
For example, $1^5 = 11111_1 \in U\ \text{if}\ 5_{10} = 101_2 \in L$ 

$U$ is also undecidable, **but** we can build a non-uniform family of circuits that computes $U$:
- for each $n$ we build two circuits with $n$ input variables 
	- $C_n^0$ that outputs $0$ if $1^n \notin U$ and 
	- $C_n^1$ that outputs $1$ if $1^n \in U$

**What is missing?**
The effective (and efficient) constructability of the circuits. 
Since $U$ is undecidable, we are not able to say if the $n-th$ circuit of the family is $C_n^0$ or $C_n^1$

#### Uniform Families of Circuits
A **uniformity condition** is often imposed on these families
- the family is **uniform** if each $C_n$ can be constructed by an appropriately resource-bounded turing machine 
- we assume that the circuits can be generated by a turing machine that on input $n$ produces a **description** of the circuit $C_n$ in time polynomial in $n$ and in the number of gates in $C_n$

### Measure of Complexity
We have three ways to measure complexity in the circuit model of computation 
- **number of gates**
- **depth of the circuit:** the length of the longest path between the data input and output in the circuit 
	- each gate on that path counts as a unit
- **total number of bits, or  wires:** aka the **width** or **space** of the circuit

### Reversible Computation
A computation is **reversible** if it is always possible to **uniquely recover the input, given the output**. 
Otherwise it is called **irreversible**.

Many classical logic gates, such as AND, OR, NAND, are inherently irreversible: given the output of the gate, the input is not uniquely determined. 

- **irreversibility $\rightarrow$ information erasure:** if a logic gate is irreversible, then some of the information in input to the gate is lost when the gates operates
- **reversible computation:** no information is ever erased because the input can always be recovered from the output:

Our present understanding of the laws of physics is that they are fundamentally reversible 
- the theory of quantum computing is related to the theory of reversible computing
- **quantum circuits must be reversible**

#### Reversible Circuits
In a reversible circuit each input pattern is uniquely mapped to an output pattern: **reversible circuits realizes bijections.**
Reversible circuits are digital circuits with the **same number of input signals and output signals**

$C_n =$ circuit with $n$ input variables

**Any classical irreversible circuit can be transformed into an equivalent reversible circuit by adding new input and output wires.**
- we need to replace all the irreversible components (gates) with their reversible counterparts
- each gate can be made reversible by adding some additional input and output if necessary

### Universality
A set of gates is **universal** for classical computation if, for any positive integers $n, m$ and for any function $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^m$, a circuit can be constructed for computing $f$ using only gates from that set. 

Well known sets of gates that are universal for classical computation are: 
- AND, OR, NOT
- AND, XOR, NOT
- ...

The NAND (NOT-AND) gate and the NOR (NOT-OR) gate have the property of **functional completeness:** any other logic function can be implemented using a combination of NAND gates (or NOR gates)

These gates are sufficient assuming **unlimited fan-out**, i.e., assuming that the output of a logic gate can be connected to one or more logic gates. 
Otherwise we need to add a FANOUT gate that outputs two copies of a single input (used to duplicate an input)

#### Reversible Circuits: Universality
The set consisting of just the Toffoli gate is universal for classical reversible computation (for the toffoli gate to be universal we need to add extra bits to the circuit that can be initialized to either $0$ or $1$ as required)

Any reversible gate can be implemented on a quantum computer, and hence the Toffoli gate is also a quantum operator. 
Therefore a quantum computer can implement all possible computations.
