The states
$$|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle, \ \ \ \ \ e^{i\theta}|\psi\rangle= e^{i\theta}\alpha|0\rangle + e^{i\theta}\beta|1\rangle$$are **equivalent** and $e^{i\theta}$ is called **global phase factor.**
The reason is that the statistics of any measurement we could perform on the state $e^{i\theta}|\psi\rangle$ are exactly the same as they would be for the state $|\psi\rangle$: **global phases have no physical significance.**

**Relative phase factors** between two orthogonal states in superposition **are physically significant:** two states that differ for a relative phase factors are physically different and not equivalent: $$
\begin{align}
\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle \equiv e^{i\theta}\alpha|0\rangle + e^{i\theta}\beta|1\rangle \\ \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle \not\equiv \alpha|0\rangle + \beta e^{i\theta}|1\rangle
\end{align}
$$

Take an arbitrary [[Bloch Sphere]] vector and rotate it around the $z$-axis: in the geographical metaphor, **we are changing its longitude**

The probability of which classical state it will collapse it is not effected: such a state change is called a **phase change** and it corresponds to altering the phase parameter $e^{i\varphi}$ in the state vector $|\psi\rangle$.
**Reminder:** if the [[Qubit]] is on the equator of the sphere the probability of collapsing in $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$ is 50-50, for every infinite position of the equator, this is the key insight to understand phase changes

Notice that we represent with$|+\rangle$ and $|-\rangle$ that kind of [[Quantum Mechanics Phenomenas#Superposition|Superposition]].
