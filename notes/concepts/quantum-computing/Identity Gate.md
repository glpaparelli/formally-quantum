The simplest [[Quantum Gate]] is the identity gate, which identically outputs the input. It is typically represented by $I$, and we have
$$
I|0\rangle = |0\rangle, \ \ \ I|1\rangle = |1\rangle
$$
This completely specifies the operation of the identity gate. 

Given the generic state $|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle$ we can input it to the identity gate to get out
$$I|\psi\rangle= I(\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle)=\alpha|0\rangle +\beta|1\rangle$$
In the [[Matrix Representation]], the $I$ is given by the identity matrix: 
$$I = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\0 & 1\end{bmatrix}$$
