We start from a well known initial state (e.g., all [[Qubit]]s in state $|0\rangle$), then the system evolves in a quantum way: qubits are connected to each other through **elementary logic circuits**, and are manipulated by a simple set of rules (basically **rotations of the vector that represent the quantum state**)

1. superposition of states
2. superposition of calculations
3. superposition of results 

When the machine measure the final state, the [[Quantum Mechanics Phenomenas#Superposition|Superposition]] of results collapses on the result with higher probability. 
The measurement, in theory, will give with high probability the solution of the problem.

Mind that **quantum computing does not violate the thesis of Church-Turing** according to which there in no model of computation substantially more powerful that the Turing machine in terms of problems solvable with it. 
**It is widely believed that even quantum computers cannot solve NP-complete problems efficiently.**

Quantum computers do not change theory of computability, meaning that everything that can be solved on a quantum computer can also be solved on a classical computer, it's just that for some problems, a classical computer may take exponentially more time.
