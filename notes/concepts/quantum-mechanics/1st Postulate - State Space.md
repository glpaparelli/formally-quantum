> Associated to any physical system there is a **complex [[Hilbert Space]]** known as the **state space** of the system. If the system is isolated, then the system is completely described by its **state vector**, which is a unit vector in the state space.

The postulate tells us that every physical system has a state space (an atom has a state space; a human being has a state space; even the universe as a whole has a state space) but it does not tell us what the state space is, for any given physical system. 
The state space **needs to be figured out on a case-by-case basis**, with additional physical theories. 

Different types of physical systems have different state spaces and depending on the system considered, the Hilbert space may be infinite-dimensional. 
We will always assume that the space is described by a vector in a finite-dimensional complex vector space.
