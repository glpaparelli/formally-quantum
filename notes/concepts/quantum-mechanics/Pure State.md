A quantum state is a mathematical description of a quantum system. 
A pure quantum state is a state that can be described by a single $ket$ vector, using the [[Dirac Notation]]. 

A $ket$ vector is a column vector in a [[Hilbert Space]] that represents the state of a quantum system ([[1st Postulate - State Space]]). 

**A pure state is a state where we have exact information about the quantum system**
