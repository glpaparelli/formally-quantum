A mixed quantum state, on the other hand, is a statistical ensemble of [[Pure State]]s. 

It corresponds to a probabilistic mixture of pure states, where different distributions of pure states can generate equivalent mixed states.

A mixed state cannot be described by a single ket vector (using the [[Dirac Notation]]), but rather by a [[Density Operator]]. 
A density matrix is a [[Positive Operator]] semi-definite matrix that has [[Trace]] $1$ 

In quantum mechanics, mixed states arise in two different situations: 
- when the preparation of the system is not fully known, and thus one must deal with a statistical ensemble of possible preparations
- when one wants to describe a physical system that is entangled with another, as its state cannot be described by a pure state.
