### Superposition
Related to [[1st Postulate - State Space]]

Property of a quantum system to be in different **states** at the same time
- a quantum system can be in **more than one state** with non-zero amplitudes
- we say that our system is in a superposition of these states ([[Quantum States]])
- when evolving from a superposition, the resulting transitions may affect each other constructively and destructively: this happens because of having opposite transition amplitudes
### Decoherence
Related to [[3rd Postulate - Quantum Measurement]]

The attempt to observe or measure the state of the system causes its collapse towards a single state
- the probability of the system to be observed in a specified state is the square value of the amplitudes of the state
- after the measurement the system is no longer in a superposition
- the experimental manipulation of quantum systems is extremely difficult because every minimal disturbance can determine the decoherence
### No-Cloning
It is impossible to create an independent and identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state. 
**Example:** it is impossible to clone a quantum variable or a [[Quantum Register]]. 
### Entanglement
Possibility that two or more elements are in quantum states correlated with each other so that, even if transported at a great distance from each other, they maintain the correlation.
