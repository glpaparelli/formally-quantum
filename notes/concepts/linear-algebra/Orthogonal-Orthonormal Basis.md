If the [[Inner Product]] is introduced in a [[Vector Space]], we can define the notion of **orthogonality**. 
We say that two vectors $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{u}$ are **orthogonal**, written $\mathbf{v}\bot\mathbf{u}$, if their inner product is 0.

A [[Basis]] is said **orthogonal** if all vectors are mutually orthogonal.
A [[Basis]] is said **orthonormal** if all vectors are normalized (with [[Norm]] $=1$) and mutually orthogonal.
