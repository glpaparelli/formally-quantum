We use the [[Dirac Notation]] to represent vectors.

A **trace-class operator** is a [[Linear Transformation]] for which a [[Trace]] may be defined, such that the trace is a finite number independent of the choice of the basis used to compute the trace. 

An operator $\mathcal{A}$ is said to be a trace-class operator if $\{\langle\psi_i|A|\psi_i\rangle\}_{i\in I}$ is a [[Summable Sequence]], hence the trace is well-defined and finite, for any orthonormal basis of $\{|\psi_i\rangle\}_{i\in I}$. 

In this case the trace $tr(A)$ is defined as $$tr(A) = \Sigma_i\langle\psi|A|\psi_i\rangle$$**said easy:**
The trace of a matrix is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal. 
If we represent the linear operator $\mathcal{A}$ in the orthonormal basis ${|\psi_i\rangle}_{i\in I}$ as a matrix $A$, then the diagonal elements of $A$ are given by $\langle\psi_i|\mathcal{A}|\psi_i\rangle | i\in I$. 
This follows from the definition of matrix elements, which are obtained by taking the [[Inner Product]] of the corresponding basis vector.
