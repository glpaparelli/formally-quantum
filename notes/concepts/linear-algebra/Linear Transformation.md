A **Linear Transformation** is a function that maps vectors from one [[Vector Space]] to another while preserving the linear structure of the vector spaces. 
A [[Linear Operator]] (technically) is a specific type of linear transformation where the domain and codomain spaces are the same. 

In other words, **a linear operator is a linear transformation that maps vectors from a vector space back to the same vector space**. 

A linear transformation can be represented by a matrix using the [[Matrix Representation]], and it can be applied to vectors by matrix multiplication.
Linear operators can also be represented by matrices, but the matrices are square since the domain and codomain spaces are the same.

**The terms "linear transformation" and "linear operator" are used interchangeably, in this notes, unless stated otherwise.**
