A **linear transformation** is a function that maps vectors from one [[Vector Space]] to another while preserving the linear structure of the vector spaces. 

It takes vectors as input and produces vectors as output. 
A linear transformation can be represented by a matrix using the [[Matrix Representation]], and it can be applied to vectors by matrix multiplication.

A [[Linear Operator]] is a specific type of linear transformation where the domain and codomain spaces are the same. 
In other words, **a linear operator is a linear transformation that maps vectors from a vector space back to the same vector space**. 
In summary:
- A linear transformation is a function that maps vectors from one vector space to another.
- A linear operator is a specific type of linear transformation where the domain and codomain spaces are the same.

Linear operators can also be represented by matrices, but the matrices are square since the domain and codomain spaces are the same.

It's worth noting that the terms "linear transformation" and "linear operator" are sometimes used interchangeably, especially in certain contexts.
