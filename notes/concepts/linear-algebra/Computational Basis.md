We use the [[Dirac Notation]] to represent vectors.

The **computational** [[Basis]] of the [[Complex Numbers]] [[Vector Space]] $\mathbb{C}^n$, denoted by $\{|0\rangle, \dots, |n-1\rangle\}$, is given by
$$
|0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ . \\ . \\ 0\end{bmatrix},\ \dots, \ |n-1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ . \\ . \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$
This basis is also know as **canonical basis**. 

When we use small-caption letters within a ket or bra we are referring to the computational basis, 
e.g.: $|i\rangle$ is the $i-th$ vector of the computational basis .
