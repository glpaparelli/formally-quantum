An isometry is a [[Linear Transformation]] that preserves distances between vectors in a [[Metric Space]]. 
It is a distance-preserving transformation between metric spaces. 

An isometry of a [[Vector Space]] is a linear operator that preserves the [[Inner Product]] of vectors. 
A linear operator that preserves the inner product is an isometry because the distance of two vectors is computed with the [[Norm]] of their difference.

Isometries include rotation, translation, reflection, glides, and the identity map.
