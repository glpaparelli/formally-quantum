An isometry is a [[Linear Transformation]] that preserves distances between vectors in a metric space. 
It is a distance-preserving transformation between metric spaces. 

An isometry of a vector space is a linear transformation that preserves the [[Inner Product]] of vectors in a [[Hilbert Space]], it preserves the inner product of vectors **because** it preserves distances between vectors.

Isometries include rotation, translation, reflection, glides, and the identity map.
