We use the [[Dirac Notation]] to represent vectors.

Let $k$ be an integer, then the $k-$translation operator on $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ is defined by $$U_{+k}|n\rangle= |n+k\rangle$$for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}$. $U_{+k}$ is a [[Unitary Transformation on QC]]. 

**The k-translation operator is defined as an operator that acts on a vector to produce a translated version of that vector.**

Given a vector $|n\rangle$ the vector $|n+k\rangle$ is obtained by adding $k$ to every component of $|n\rangle$.
