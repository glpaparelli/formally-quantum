The **Dot Product** is a specific type of [[Inner Product]] that is defined on vectors in Euclidean space.

**The dot product takes two vectors of the same dimension and returns a scalar, which is the sum of the products of their corresponding components.** 

In other words, if $\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)$ and $\mathbf{b} = (b_1, b_2, ..., b_n)$, then their Dot Product is $$\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n$$ 
**Reminder:**
The inner product is a more general concept that is defined on [[Vector Space]]s. 
An inner product is a function that takes two vectors and returns a scalar, subject to certain conditions. Specifically, an inner product is a **bilinear**, **positive-definite**, **symmetric** form. 
In summary, the dot product is a specific type of inner product that is defined on vectors in Euclidean space, while the inner product is a more general concept that is defined on vector spaces and satisfies certain conditions.
