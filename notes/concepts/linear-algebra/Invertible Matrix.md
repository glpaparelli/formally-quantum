An $n\times n$ square matrix $A$ is called **invertible** if there exists an n\times $n\times n$ square matrix $B$ such that $$AB = BA = I$$where $I$ is the $n\times n$ identity matrix and the multiplication used is ordinary matrix multiplication.

If this is the case, then the matrix $B$ is uniquely determined by $A$, and is called the **inverse of $A$**, denoted by $A^{âˆ’1}$. 

Matrix inversion is the process of finding the matrix $B$ that satisfies the prior equation for a given invertible matrix $A$.
