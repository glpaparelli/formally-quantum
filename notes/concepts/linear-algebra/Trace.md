The trace of a square matrix $A$, denoted $tr(A)$ is defined to be the **sum of elements on the main diagonal** of $A$ $$
tr(A) = \Sigma_{i=1}^na_{ii}= a_{11}+ \dots + a_{nn}
$$**The trace is only defined for a square matrices.**

Given some [[Linear Operator]] $\mathcal{F} : V â†’ V$, where $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space, we can define the trace of this operator by considering the trace of a [[Matrix Representation]] of $\mathcal{F}$: chose a basis for $V$ and describing $\mathcal{F}$ as a matrix relative to this basis, then take the trace of this square matrix. 

The result will not depend on the basis chosen, since different bases will give rise to [[Similar Matrices]], allowing for the possibility of a basis-independent definition for the trace of a linear map.
