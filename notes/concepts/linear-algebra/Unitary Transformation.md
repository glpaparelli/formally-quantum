A [[Linear Transformation]] $\mathcal{U}$ (on a [[Hilbert Space]] $\mathcal{H}$) is called a **unitary operator**, represented as a matrix using the [[Matrix Representation]] and indicated with $U$ where $U$ is a [[Unitary Matrix]], if $$U^\dagger U = I_\mathcal{H}$$where $I_\mathcal{H}$ is the identity operator on $\mathcal{H}$ and $U^\dagger$ is the [[Adjoint]] of $U$

Unitary operators are precisely [[Isometry|isometries]], because the "[[Norm]] equation"$$||S\mathbf{u}|| = ||\mathbf{u}||$$ holds for every $\mathbf{u}$ if and only if $S$ is unitary.
