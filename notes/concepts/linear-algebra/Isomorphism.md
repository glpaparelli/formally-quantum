Let's consider two [[Vector Space]]s, $V$ and $W$. 

An **isomorphism** between $V$ and $W$ is a [[Linear Operator]] that has the following properties:
- **one-to-one**: for every vector $\mathbf v$ in $V$, there is a **unique** vector $\mathbf w$ in $W$ such that the isomorphism maps $\mathbf v$ to $\mathbf w$: this means that different vectors in $V$ are mapped to different vectors in $W$, and no two vectors in $V$ are mapped to the same vector in $W$
- **onto**: for every vector $\mathbf w$ in $W$, there is a vector $\mathbf v$ in $V$ such that the isomorphism maps $\mathbf v$ to $\mathbf w$: this means that every vector in $W$ has a pre-image in $V$ under the isomorphism
- **linearity**: the isomorphism preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication: this means that for any vectors $\mathbf v_1$ and $\mathbf v_2$ in $V$ and any scalar $c$, the isomorphism maps $c\mathbf v_1 + \mathbf v2$ to $cf(\mathbf v_1) + f(\mathbf v_2)$, where $f$ represents the isomorphism.

When two vector spaces $V$ and $W$ are isomorphic, they share the same essential properties and can be considered "the same" in terms of their linear structure. 
Isomorphic vector spaces have the same dimension and can be transformed into each other without losing any important information about their structure.
