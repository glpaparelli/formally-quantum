We use the [[Dirac Notation]] to represent vectors.

An **eigenvector** of a [[Linear Operator]] $\mathcal{A}: V \rightarrow V$ is a non-zero vector $|v\rangle$ such that $\mathcal{A}|v\rangle = \lambda|v\rangle$
for some (complex) number $\lambda$, which is called **eigenvalue**.

The eigenvalues of $\mathcal{A}$ are obtained as solutions of the **characteristic equation** $\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = 0$, where $det()$ is the [[Determinant]]. 

Each operator has at least one eigenvalue.
