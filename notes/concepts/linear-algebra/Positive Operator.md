We use the [[Dirac Notation]] to represent vectors.

An [[Unitary Transformation on QC]] $\mathcal{A}$ on $\mathcal{H}$ is said to be **positive** if $\langle\psi|A|\psi\rangle\geq0$ for all states $|\psi\rangle\in\mathcal{H}$. 
Every positive operator is an [[Hermitian Operator]]. 

### Positive Matrix
This part is from [[Towards a Quantum Programming Language]]:

A matrix $A$ is called **positive semidefinite** or simply **positive**, if it an [[Hermitian Operator#Hermitian Matrix|Hermitian matrix]] and $\mathbf{u}^\top A\mathbf{u} \geq 0\ \forall\ \mathbf{u}$.
Positive matrices are closed under addition and non-negative real scalar multiplies. 

Every positive matrix is a non-negative real linear combination of [[Pure Matrix|pure matrices]]. 

#### Remarks 2.2
Every positive matrix $A\in \mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$ is of the form $BB^\dagger$, for some $B\in \mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$
