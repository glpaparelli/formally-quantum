To represent a [[Linear Transformation]] with a matrix, we need to choose a [[Basis]] for the domain and the codomain of the linear operator. 

Let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces over some field $\mathbb{F}$, and let $\mathcal{B} = {\mathbf v_1,\mathbf v_2, \dots,\mathbf v_n}$ and $\mathcal{C} = {\mathbf w_1,\mathbf w_2, \dots,\mathbf w_m}$ be ordered bases for $V$ and $W$, respectively and let $\mathcal{A}: V \rightarrow W$ be a linear operator. 

We can give a matrix representation of $\mathcal{A}$ as follows:
- for each $j = 1, 2, \dots, n$, apply $\mathcal{A}$ to the $j$-th basis vector $\mathbf v_j$ in $\mathcal{B}$ to obtain the vector $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf v_j)$ in $W$.
- write $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf v_j)$ as a linear combination of the basis vectors in $\mathcal{C}$: $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf v_j) = a_{1,j}\mathbf w_1 + a_{2,j}\mathbf w_2 + \dots + a_{m,j}\mathbf w_m$.
- the matrix representation of $\mathcal{A}$ with respect to the bases $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{C}$ is the $m \times n$ matrix $[a_{i,j}]$, where $a_{i,j}$ is the coefficient of $w_i$ in the expansion of $\mathcal{A}(v_j)$.

Clearly, if the linear operator has the same vector space for domain and codomain the basis used will be the same.

This matrix representation of a linear operator allows us to perform computations and transformations on vectors and vector spaces using matrix operations.
It also provides a way to compare and analyze different linear operators based on their matrix representations.
