We use the [[Dirac Notation]] to represent vectors.

Associated with any [[Linear Transformation]] $\mathcal{A}$ (on an [[Hilbert Space]]) expressed with its [[Matrix Representation]] $A$, there is its **adjoint** $A^\dagger$, which satisfies $\langle v|Aw\rangle = \langle A^\dagger v|w\rangle$.

In **matrix terms**: $A^\dagger = \bar{A}^T$ where $\bar{A}$ denotes the [[Complex Numbers]] **conjugate** and $^T$ denote **transposition**.
