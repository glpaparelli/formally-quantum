This part is from [[Towards a Quantum Programming Language]]. 

A square matrix $S \in \mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$ is called **unitary** if $S^\dagger S = I$ where $I$ is the identity matrix, or equivalently if the [[Adjoint]] of $S$, represented with $S^\dagger$, is $S^{-1}$ (the [[Invertible Matrix|inverse matrix]])

If $S$ is a unitary matrix and $A = SBS^\dagger$, then $tr(A) = tr(B)$. 
Thus, the [[Trace]] is invariant under the unitary [[Change of Basis]].
