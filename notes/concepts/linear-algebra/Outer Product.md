We use the [[Dirac Notation]] to represent vectors.

The outer product of two vectors is the matrix whose entries are all products of an element in the first vector with an element in the second vector. 
If the two vectors $|u\rangle, |v\rangle$ have dimensions $n$ and $m$, then their outer product is an $n\times m$ matrix.
$$|u\rangle\langle v| = \begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ . \\ . \\ . \\ u_n\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} v_1 & \dots &v_n\end{bmatrix} = A = \begin{bmatrix} u_1v_1 & \dots & \dots\ u_1v_n \\ . & & . \\ . & & . \\ . & & . \\ u_nv_1 & \dots & \dots\ u_nv_n\end{bmatrix}$$
