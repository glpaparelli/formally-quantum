The determinant is a scalar value that is a function of the entries of a square matrix. 

It characterizes some properties of the matrix and the [[Linear Transformation]] represented by the matrix. 

In particular, the determinant is nonzero if and only if the matrix is an [[Invertible Matrix]] and the linear map represented by the matrix is an [[Isomorphism]]. 

The determinant of a product of matrices is the product of their determinants (the preceding property is a corollary of this one). 

The determinant of a matrix $A$ is denoted $det(A)$, $det A$, or $|A|$.
