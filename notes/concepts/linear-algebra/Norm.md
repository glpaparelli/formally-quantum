Having defined the [[Inner Product]] we can define the **Norm of a vector**

The norm represents the **length of a vector**. 
The norm of $\mathbf{v}$, denoted by $||\mathbf{v}||$, is defined as: $$||\mathbf{v}|| = \sqrt{(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})}$$said easy: **the norm of a vector is the squared root of the inner product of the vector with itself.**

A **normalized vector** aka **unit vector** is a vector $\mathbf{v}$ whose norm is equal to $1$.
