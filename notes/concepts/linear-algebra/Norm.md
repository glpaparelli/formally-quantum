We also introduce the notion of **norm** using the [[Inner Product]].

The norm represents the **length of a vector**. 
The norm of $\mathbf{v}$, denoted by $||\mathbf{v}||$, is defined as: $$||\mathbf{v}|| = \sqrt{(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})}$$A **normalized vector** or **unit vector** is a vector $\mathbf{v}$ whose norm is equal to $1$.
