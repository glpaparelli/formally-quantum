This part is from [[Floyd-Hoare Logic for Quantum Programs]]. 

The cylinder extension is a mathematical concept that allows for the extension of a [[Linear Operator]] on a specific subsystem to the entire [[Hilbert Space]] using the [[Tensor Product]] with the identity operator on the remaining subsystems.

The cylinder extension allows for the analysis of the behavior of a quantum program on a specific subsystem in the context of the entire system. 
This is useful in the context of quantum programming and verification, where the correctness of a quantum program needs to be verified on the entire system, not just on a specific subsystem
