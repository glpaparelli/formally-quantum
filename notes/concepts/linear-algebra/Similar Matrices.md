Two $n\times n$ matrices $A$ and $B$ are called **similar** if there exists an [[Invertible Matrix]] $n\times n$ $P$ such that $$B = P^{-1}AP$$
**Similar matrices represent the same** [[Linear Operator]] under two (possibly) different bases, with $P$ being the [[Change of Basis]] matrix.
Because matrices are similar if and only if they represent the same linear operator with respect to (possibly) different bases, similar matrices share all properties of their shared underlying operator.
