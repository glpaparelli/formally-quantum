Two $n\times n$ matrices $A$ and $B$ are called **similar** if there exists an invertible $n\times n$ matrix $P$ such that $$B = P^{-1}AP$$
**Similar matrices represent the same** [[Linear Operator]] under two (possibly) different bases, with $P$ being the change of basis matrix.
Because matrices are similar if and only if they represent the same linear operator with respect to (possibly) different bases, similar matrices share all properties of their shared underlying operator.
