A **metric space** is a set of objects (usually points) with a distance function (called a metric) defined between them. 
The metric measures the distance between any two points in the space. 

While every [[Vector Space]] is a metric space, not every metric space is a vector space. 
The difference between the two is that a vector space has additional algebraic structure (addition and scalar multiplication) that is not present in a metric space. 
In a vector space, we can add vectors and multiply them by scalars, while in a metric space, we can only measure distances between points.
